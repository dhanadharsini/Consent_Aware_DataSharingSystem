PROJECT TITLE : CONSENT AWARE DATA SHARING SYSTEM

Project Overview:
The Consent Aware Data Sharing System is a secure application designed to manage, track, and enforce user consent for sensitive data sharing between different entities such as patients and hospitals. The system ensures transparency, user control, and compliance with data privacy principles by allowing consent creation, approval, revocation, and automatic expiry.

     This project is especially useful in domains like healthcare, where sensitive personal data must only be shared with explicit and time-bound user consent.

Work Flow:
     Authentication & Authorization

         Secure login using JWT-based authentication

         Role-based access (Patient, Hospital)

     Consent Management

         Create consent requests

         Approve or reject consent

         Revoke consent at any time

         Automatic consent expiry based on end time

     Auto Expiry Mechanism

         Approved consents automatically change to EXPIRED after the expiry time
